      When we talk about speed, then the first name that comes to mind when
      thinking of computers is supercomputers. They are the biggest and fastest
      computers (in terms of speed of processing data). Supercomputers are
      designed such that they can process a huge amount of data, like processing
      trillions of instructions or data just in a second. This is because of the
      thousands of interconnected processors in supercomputers. It is basically
      used in scientific and engineering applications such as weather
      forecasting, scientific simulations, and nuclear energy research. It was
      first developed by Roger Cray in 1976.
